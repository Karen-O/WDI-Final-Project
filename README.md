# WDI Final Project

## User Stories

### A user should be able to...

- Create an account, so that user data is saved between logins.
- Use the app without creating an account, in order to try out the site or just use it in its default state. (User data will not be saved.)
- Visualize the relations and functionalities that exist among the component parts of an MVC-structured Rails app, via a dynamic System Diagram that acts as "Starting Point" and interactively informs the rest of the app.
- Develop an in-depth understanding and **working knowledge** of each aforementioned "component part," in terms of the key basics, integral higher-level concepts, and new terms/definitions applicable to each specific language/entity.
- Select a single component of the Rails MVC system to focus on practicing, learning and memorizing via the "flashcard study method" (now digitized and optimized).
- Alter the display and/or behavior of a flashcard in order to customize the learning experience and enhance its effectiveness.
- Combine the flashcards of 2 or more component topics in order to self-test on an increasingly broad/complex knowledge scope.
- Conversely, easily "scale back" complexity by undoing/removing customizations to the card stack.
